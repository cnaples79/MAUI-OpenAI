- **Immersive Experience:** Immerse yourself in a unique, interactive experience that brings your chats to life.
- **Personalized Interactions:** Customize your interactions with the AI to suit your preferences and create a more engaging experience.
- **Custom Tokenizer:** This project uses a custom tokenizer to process the input text before sending it to the OpenAI API.

## Custom Tokenizer üß†

- **Purpose:** The custom tokenizer is designed to preprocess the input text before sending it to the OpenAI API.
- **Important Information:**
  - The custom tokenizer is implemented in the `TokenizerService.cs` file in the `Services` folder.
  - The custom tokenizer in this project is more conservative than the default OpenAI tokenizer.
    - OpenAI provides the following estimates for their tokenizer:
      - 1 token ‚âà 4 characters in English
      - 1 token ‚âà ¬æ words
      - 100 tokens ‚âà 75 words
    - The custom tokenizer in this project estimates 1 token ‚âà 3.5 characters in English.
  - User and assistant messages are appended to a `Conversation` list, which is then tokenized and sent to the OpenAI API.
    - The `Conversation` object allows for a maximum of 80,000 tokens.
      - Once the conversation reaches 80,000 tokens, the oldest messages are removed to make room for new messages.
      - GPT-4o model allows for a maximum of 128,000 tokens in the Context Window.
        - The purpose of such conservative tokenization is to ensure that the conversation remains within the token limit, while the model can still retain context from previous messages.
  - Each user message allows for a maximum of 1000 tokens.
    - If the user message reaches 1000 tokens, further input is disabled.
